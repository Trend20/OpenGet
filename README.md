**We are open to collaboration.** Please check open issues in the above repos if you want to contribute, or open a new one if you have an idea you'd like to discuss.

OpenGet is a free website for open-source projects. We are tightly integrated with Github, allowing us to automatically get access to almost every open-source project out there.
